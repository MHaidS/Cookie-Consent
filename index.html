				<p>Want a great job in tech? Want a six-figure salary? Then you have come to the right place. I am going to tell you all
					you need to know to get all of that and much more, without you lifting a finger. You can learn passively. Just sit back,
					close your eyes, and let the sound of my voice make the code sink deep into your brain. </p>

<!-- 
=> setTimeout ===> to ctrl when the modal pop-up appears
=> element.style ===> to dynamically update an element's css properties
=> forms ===> created a form w/ the input types of 'text' & 'email'
=> formData & .get() ===> formData was used to get data fr the form as an object & the .get() was used to actually access that data in order to be used in this app
=> event.preventDefault ===> to get more control over how we submit our forms
=> CSS: row-reverse ===> a neat & nasty way of preventing the users to hit the decline button using 'flex-direction: row-reverse'
=> toggling classes ===> classes were toggled on & off
=> 'disabled' attribute ===> blocked users fr using the 'close' button
